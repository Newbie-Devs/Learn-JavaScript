//Variables are containers for storing data values.
//The value of a variable can change throughout the program.
//Use the var keyword to declare a variable:
var x = 10; //the value 10 is assigned to the variable x.

//JavaScript is case sensitive: the variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables.

//In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is called the "assignment" operator, rather than an "equal to" operator.
//For example, x = y will assign the value of y to x
//A variable can be declared without a value.
//A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined

var x = 100;
document.write(x);
//the value 100 is assigned to the variable x and then it is writedd into the HTML document

/*
Using variables is useful in many ways.
You might have a thousand lines of code that may include the variable x.
When you change the value of x one time, it will automatically be changed in all places where you used it.
*/


//Every written "instruction" is called a statement.
//JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons.

/*
Naming rules:
The first character must be a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Numbers are not allowed as the first character.
Variable names cannot include a mathematical or logical operator in the name.
JavaScript names must not contain spaces.

//Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. It is reserved for subtractions.
