//Comments are ignored, and are not executed.
//Single line comments use double slashes.
<script>
   // This is a single line comment
   alert("This is an alert box!");

//It's a good idea to make a comment about the logic of large functions to make your code more readable for others.

//Everything you write between /*and */ will be considered as a multi-line comment.
<script>
   /* This code 
   creates an 
   alert box */
   alert("This is an alert box!");
</script>


<script>
       document.write("Hello World!");
</script>

//The document.write() function writes a string into our HTML document.

//Just like in HTML, we can use HTML tags to format text in JavaScript.
//For example, we can output the text as a heading:
<script>
       document.write("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");
 </script>
